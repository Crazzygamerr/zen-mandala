# Zen-mandala

I created this project due to my fascination with animated mandalas. The YouTube channel called [Armonian](https://www.youtube.com/@Armonian) makes some amazing ones and the first mandala is their design. 

The goals of this project will keep evolving as progress is made in the implementation side. Right now it is to create a backend and format that is flexible enough to handle all the features and animations.

## Features

- Using PIXI.js for rendering
- Mandala, MandalaLayer, and Shape abstraction
- Preset shapes and custom shapes
- Animation

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
